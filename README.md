Personal record of computational thermodynamics learning process

After I proposed a machine learning method to accelerate CALPHAD method, it feels guilty that I know little about the basic theory of CALPHAD method.

I want to share my learning process in this repository, from both theory learning and coding.
Theory learning will base on 'Computational Thermodynamics: The Calphad Method' written by HANS LEO LUKAS, SUZANA G. FRIES AND BO SUNDMAN.

I will learn to code by learning how pycalphad works.

If anyone found this repository and want to learn CALPHAD theory too, it is a welcome. I will try to update my learning progress everyday.
