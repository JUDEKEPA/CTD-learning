Personal record of computational thermodynamics learning process

After I proposed a machine learning method to accelerate CALPHAD method, it feels guilty that I know little about the basic theory of CALPHAD method.

I want to share my learning process in this repository, from both theory learning and coding.
Theory learning will base on 'Computational Thermodynamics: The Calphad Method' written by HANS LEO LUKAS, SUZANA G. FRIES AND BO SUNDMAN,
and 'Phase Transformations in Metals and Alloys' written by DAVID A. PORTER, KENNETH E. EASTERLING, and MOHAMED Y. SHERIF.


I will learn to code by learning how pycalphad works.

If anyone found this repository and want to learn CALPHAD theory too, it is a welcome. I will try to update my learning progress everyday.
