While the thermodynamics theory is profound and time-taking to learn every detail, the computational
thermodynamics narrow its range to specific application. Instead of understanding from a panoramic view, I
would like to learn from the view of how the theory becomes code.

From what I know about computational thermodynamics right now, I list these points that I will concentrate
on:
1. The sublattice model. Before understanding how to get data (like .TDB file), I will try to understand
what .TDB file should be like, and how to use it to calculate Gibbs energy of a certain phase with a certain
composition.
2. The global minimization. The step of global minimization is the key step in CALPHAD method. After learning
how to use sublattice model to calculate Gibbs energy, it is important to understand how global minimization
works.
